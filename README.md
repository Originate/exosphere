> _ex·o·sphere (ˈeksōˌsfir) - the outermost region of a planet's atmosphere (aka, above the clouds)_

__easy and fun micro-services__

Exosphere is a high-level devops framework
for building, testing, deploying, and operating
a wide variety of intelligent cloud, mobile, and IoT application ecosystems
with unparalleled productivity and joy.

- scaffold, run, test, deploy, operate, and evolve fleets of polyglot micro-services
  without boilerplate code and process
- develop against explicit
  functional, performance, security, and reliability requirements<sup>&#42;</sup>
- runs on top of public and private cloud environments
  like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com),
  [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com),
  [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com),
  [DCOS](https://dcos.io), etc<sup>&#42;</sup>
- can use any service running in Docker


__Benefits:__

Exosphere addresses some of the biggest sources of failure in software projects:
- monoliths accumulate complexity and cruft
  to the point of nobody knowing what's going on anymore
- microservices require several orders of magnitude more effort around devops
  and are a pain to manage if not fully automated
- you need a lot of senior engineering talent to manage this mess

Business owners benefit from
faster innovation and
seamless scaling of prototypes into maintainable production-grade solutions.
This happens at lower overall cost and risk,
giving you a competitive advantage in today's fast-moving markets.
