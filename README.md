- [exo add](documentation/commands/add.md)
  adds a new service to the application
- [exo clean](documentation/commands/clean.md)
  cleans docker workspace
- [exo configure](documentation/commands/configure.md)
  manages remotely stored application secrets
- [exo deploy](documentation/commands/deploy.md)
  pushes the application to public or private clouds
- [exo generate](documentation/commands/generate.md)
  generates docker compose and terraform files
- [exo init](documentation/commands/init.md)
  initializes a new exosphere application
- [exo run](documentation/commands/run.md)
  runs an Exosphere application on the local machine
- [exo test](documentation/commands/test.md)
  runs all the tests for an application

To configure Exosphere you can use these utility commands:
- [exo template](documentation/commands/template.md)
