_yak shaver for cloud developers_

Exosphere helps work on cloud applications.
It automates the repetitive activities
to get them built, running, tested, and deployed.

- [exo run](documentation/commands/run.md)
  prepares the application to run (by installing dependencies and compiling it)
  and boots it up
- [exo test](documentation/commands/test.md)
  runs the tests for all services as well as for the application
- [exo deploy](documentation/commands/)
  pushes the application to public or private clouds
- [exo add](documentation/commands/add.md)
  scaffolds a new service based on application-specific templates

Exosphere makes industrial-strength open-source technologies
work well together based on shared configuration information:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) for source code management
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) for containerization
* [Docker Compose]() for
* [Boilr](https://github.com/tmrts/boilr) for code generation
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) for deployment
