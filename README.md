_yak shaver for cloud developers_

Exosphere helps work on cloud applications.
It automates the repetitive activities
to get them installed, built, running, tested, and deployed:

- [exo configure](documentation/commands/configure.md)
  manages remotely stored application secrets
- [exo run](documentation/commands/run.md)
  runs an Exosphere application on the local machine
- [exo test](documentation/commands/test.md)
  runs all the tests for an application
- [exo deploy](documentation/commands/deploy.md)
  pushes the application to public or private clouds
- [exo add](documentation/commands/add.md)
  scaffolds a new service based on application-specific templates

To configure Exosphere you can use these utility commands:
- [exo template](documentation/commands/template.md)
  manages templates for services
