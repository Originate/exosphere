Feature: printing the help screens

  As a developer using Exosphere
  I want quick access to usage documentation
  So that I can use Exosphere without having to read the manual

  Scenario: executing "exo help"
    When running "exo help" in the terminal
    Then it prints "Usage: exo <command>" in the terminal
    And it does not print "Error: " in the terminal

  Scenario Outline: executing "exo help <COMMAND>" (js subcommands)
    When running "exo help <COMMAND>" in the terminal
    Then it prints "Usage: exo <COMMAND>" in the terminal
    And it does not print "Error: " in the terminal
  Examples:
    | COMMAND |
    | deploy  |
    | lint    |
    | sync    |
    | test    |

  Scenario Outline: executing "exo help <COMMAND>" (go subcommands)
    When running "exo help <COMMAND>" in the terminal
    Then it prints the following in the terminal:
      """
      Usage:
        exo <COMMAND>
      """
    And it does not print "Error: " in the terminal
  Examples:
    | COMMAND         |
    | add             |
    | clean           |
    | create          |
    | run             |
    | template        |
