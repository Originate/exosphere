Feature: Following the tutorial

  As a person learning Exosphere
  I want that the whole tutorial works end to end
  So that I can follow along with the examples without getting stuck on bugs.

  AC:
  - all steps in the tutorial work when executed one after the other

  Notes:
  - The steps only do quick verifications.
    Full verifications are in the individual specs for the respective step.
  - You can not run individual scenarios here,
    you always have to run the whole feature.


  Scenario: verify that exo commands can be run by running "exo version"
    When starting "exo version" in the terminal
    Then I see "Exosphere version" in the terminal


  Scenario: setting up the application
    Given I am in an empty folder
    When starting "exo create" in the terminal
    And entering into the wizard:
      | FIELD              | INPUT              |
      | AppName            | todo-app           |
      | AppDescription     | A todo application |
      | AppVersion         |                    |
      | ExocomVersion      | 0.22.1             |
    And waiting until the process ends
    Then my workspace contains the file "todo-app/application.yml" with content:
      """
      name: todo-app
      description: A todo application
      version: 0.0.1

      dependencies:
        - name: exocom
          version: 0.22.1

      services:
        public:
        private:
      """
    And my workspace contains the empty directory "todo-app/.exosphere"


  Scenario: adding the html service
    Given I cd into "todo-app"
    And my application contains the template folder ".exosphere/exoservice-es6-mongodb"
    And my application contains the template folder ".exosphere/htmlserver-express-es6"
    When starting "exo add" in this application's directory
    And entering into the wizard:

      | Protection Level              | 1                                |
    And waiting until the process ends
    Then my application contains the file "application.yml" with the content:
