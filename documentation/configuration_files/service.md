#### Notes:

* `remote.cpu`: Number of CPU units to reserve for service container (see "cpu" under [Container Definitions/Environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#container_definition_environment))
* `remote.memeory`: The hard limit (in MiB) of memory to allocate to the service container (see "memory" under [Container Definitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#container_definitions))

# Service types

## Public
Public services expose an external and internal http endpoint. Container ports must be listed in `development.port` and `production.port`.

Endpoints available in local development:
  - `#{SERVICE_ROLE}_EXTERNAL_ORIGIN`: The external http endpoint at which a public service can be reached. Exosphere automatically picks an available host port and binds it to the specified service container port.
  - `#{SERVICE_ROLE}_INTERNAL_ORIGIN`: The internal http endpoint at which a service can be reached. Used for internal communication with other services.

Endpoints availabe in deployment:
  - `#{SERVICE_ROLE}_EXTERNAL_ORIGIN`: The load-balanced external https endpoint, as defined by the URL listed in the `remote.envorinments.#{remote-environment-id}` block of `service.yml`. Terraform manages creation of these records in route53.
  - `#{SERVICE_ROLE}_INTERNAL_ORIGIN`: The internal http endpoint at which a service can be reached. Terraform manages creation of these records in route53. Used for internal communication with other services.


## Worker
Worker services have the option of exposing an internal non-http, non-load-balanced endpoint. If a worker service exposes a port, the container port must be listed in `development.port` and `production.port`.
Additionally, the proper `update-route53` binary must be downloaded from Exosphere's [release](https://github.com/Originate/exosphere/releases), copied into the worker service's Docker container and ran as part of that service's start-up script.
It only needs to be copied over in the `Dockerfile.prod` file. An example start script could look like the following:
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

update-route53 $ROLE $INTERNAL_HOSTED_ZONE_NAME
node src/server.js
```
`$ROLE` is passed into every service automatically, but `$INTERNAL_HOSTED_ZONE_NAME` must be set by the user as an environment variable in each remote environment block, and they must be of the form `#{service-role}.#{remote-environment-id}-#{app-name}.local`.

Endpoints available in local development:
  - `#{SERVICE_ROLE}_HOST`: The internal endpoint at which a service can be reached

Endpoints available in deployment:
  - `#{SERVICE_ROLE}_HOST`: The internal endpoint at which a service can be reached
