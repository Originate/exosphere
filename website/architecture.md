# Exosphere Architecture

Exosphere consists of:

- an __architecture model__ for composing intelligent applications
  out of reusable, collaborating services
  that exchange semantically meaningful statements and insights
  about their domain

- an __SDK__ for building, testing, and evolving such applications
  out of highly reusable components

- a highly automated __devops platform__
  for deploying and running these applications highly scalable and resilient
  in the cloud
