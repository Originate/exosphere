# Benefits

This page provides more details on how Exosphere can help you succeed.


### Business benefits

* __faster innovation:__
  With Exosphere you quickly develop and launch
  fully functional prototypes of cloud applications,
  by plugging together existing front-end and back-end building blocks
  like Lego bricks.
  As the prototype solidifies and gains traction,
  you can gradually evolve it into a production-grade application
  by replacing one service at a time with more specific implementations,
  This avoids the dreaded [Big Rewrite](http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/2596/Why-You-Should-Almost-Never-Rewrite-Your-Software.aspx)
  while keeping technical debt contained and manageable.

* __risk reduction:__
  Your developers can reuse up to 80% of the code of one Exosphere application in other applications.
  This means investments never really fail,
  because even if a particular application is not successful,
  its large parts of the developed technology live on in other projects.
  Exosphere also allows more agile workflows.
  You start with a [walking skeleton](http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2014/03/20/kickstart-your-next-project-with-a-walking-skeleton),
  and add

* __cost savings:__
  Exosphere saves you cost in several ways.
  Being able to plug together applications out of highly reusable components
  is just the start.
  Exosphere also heavily automates many of the processes and workflows
  around deployment, hosting, and devops,
  allowing you to get more done with smaller teams and less training.
  Current tech stacks and code bases are so complicated
  that only the top 10-20% of the worldwide engineering talent can work on them
  with a high chance of success.
  Exosphere has a lot of best practices built in,
  it breaks down code bases and complexity to levels
  that allow even less experienced engineers to create good enough code
  under the supervision of experienced tech leadership.
  it automated many repetitive tasks,
  and provides powerful and easy to use devops tools.
  This means you need less specialized Ops personnel.

* __free and open:__
  Exosphere is open, free, and extensible,
  so you don't get locked into a proprietary, vendor-specific solution.

* __sustainability:__
  Many best practices around managing complexity, changes, security, and performance
  are built into and enforced by the framework.
  Making it easy to follow them allows you to
  sustain higher level of development velocity and code quality
  as you scale up your business and IT operations.


### Technology benefits


- pain-free __micro-services:__
  Most existing micro-service frameworks have been developed by
  very seasoned teams at top-tier tech companies,
  designed for dealing with extremely large code bases and massive scale.
  Often they have evolved out of existing architectures,
  and are designed for extreme-scale operation by seasoned developers and ops teams.
  Exosphere is one of the first frameworks
  that is designed from the ground up for micro-services,
  for getting started easily, by smaller and fast-moving teams.
  Everybody who has tried microservices has found that they have benefits,
  but quickly become painful because there are so many more moving pieces in production,
  and everything must be heavily automated.
  Exosphere provides this level of automation and best practices,
  and contains everything needed to scale up to levels sufficient for 99% of all businesses in the world.

- __human friendly:__
  Exosphere contains very modern technology,
  packaged up into a solution that is optimized for
  human ergonomics, being intuitive, productive, and fun.

- __automated:__
  the framework goes the extra mile so that its users don't have to.
  It automates most of the boilerplate and best practices.

- __efficient and flexible:__
  Exosphere offers highly productive, opinionated conventions
  on top of a generic foundation

- __goals driven:__
  Exosphere provides mechanisms to develop against explicit
  functional, performance, security, and reliability requirements<sup>&#42;</sup>

- __multi-cloud:__
  data-center aware, runs on top of public and private cloud environments
  like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com),
  [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com),
  [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com),
  [DCOS](https://dcos.io), etc<sup>&#42;</sup>

- marketplace for reusable services<sup>&#42;</sup>
