# "exo clone" command

`exo clone` downloads the various parts of an application onto your machine.
No matter whether these parts are part of a monorepo, each one in their own repository,
or are provided as a Docker image.
Run this command, get a coffee, and when you return,
you have a fully operational application waiting for you.
