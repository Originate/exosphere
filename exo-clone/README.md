# "exo clone" command

This repo contains the code for the "exo clone" command. This is part of the [Exosphere SDK](https://github.com/Originate/exosphere-sdk)

`exo clone` downloads the various parts of an application onto your machine - 
no matter whether these parts are part of a monorepo, each one in their own repository,
or are provided as a Docker image.
Run this command, get a coffee, and when you return,
you have a fully operational application waiting for you.
