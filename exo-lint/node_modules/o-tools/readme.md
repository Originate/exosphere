O-tools-node adds a number of standardized command-line utilities
to develop Node.JS code bases more effectively:


#### setup

This command makes a freshly checked out code base runnable and testable.
The default version in this repo checks that the paths are properly set up
and runs `npm install`.
If you code base needs other setup steps,
put your own `setup` script into its `./bin` folder.

```
$ setup
```


#### lint

Runs all linters.
The default script in this repo runs [dependency-lint](https://github.com/charlierudolph/dependency-lint).

```
$ lint
```


#### update-check

Checks whether updates to your dependencies are available.

```
$ update-check
```


#### update

Updates all your dependencies to their latest versions.

```
$ update
```


#### publish

Releases a new version of your product to the world.

```
$ publish <patch|minor|major>
```


## Installation

1. add this module as a development dependency

  ```
  $ npm i --save-dev o-tools-node
  ```

1. make sure your PATH includes `./bin` and `./node_modules/.bin` (in this order)

1. optionally add these scripts to your code base:

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>bin/build</th>
      <td>builds your project (transpiles to JS, compresses)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>bin/spec</th>
      <td>runs all tests and linters</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  If you develop in [LiveScript](http://livescript.net),
  use [o-tools-livescript](https://github.com/Originate/o-tools-livescript)
  for an out-of-the-box solution.

1. set up your CI server to automatically publish
  new releases from the `release` branch:
  * add a `deployment` section
    similar to [the one in this repo](circle.yml)
    to your circle.yml file
  * go to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/tokens) >
    User Account > Tokens
  * copy an authentication token into the clipboard
  * add an environment variable called `AUTH_TOKEN` with the npm auth token as content
    * On [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) this is done
      by going to: Project Settings > Environment Variables
