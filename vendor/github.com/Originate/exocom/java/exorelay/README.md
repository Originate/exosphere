# Exosphere Communication Relay for Java
Communication relay between Java code bases and the Exosphere environment

NOTE: This version of ExoRelay is incomplete - it does not support reply handlers yet. It also uses the outdated messaging library ZMQ. The current version of Exosphere uses WebSockets to send messages between ExoRelay and ExoCom.
