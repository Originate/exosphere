Feature: help command

  As a developer not familiar with how to call "exo clean" correctly
  I want to be given helpful information how to use this application
  So that I can do the things I intended without having to look this up somewhere else.


  Scenario: the user enters 'exo help'
    When running "exo help" in the terminal
    Then I see:
      """
      Usage:
        exo [command]

      Available Commands:
        add         Adds a new service to the current application
        clean       Removes dangling Docker images and volumes
        create      Create a new Exosphere application
        version     Exosphere go version number

      Use "exo [command] --help" for more information about a command
      """


  Scenario: the user enters 'exo add help'
    When running "exo add help" in the terminal
    Then I see:
      """

      Usage:
